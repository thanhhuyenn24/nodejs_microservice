🚀 Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end observability system for a microservices-based e‑commerce application. We use:

OpenTelemetry – collect and export distributed traces

OpenTelemetry Collector – receive, process and forward telemetry data

Jaeger – visualize traces and analyze bottlenecks

Locust – generate traffic and run load tests

Toxiproxy – inject network faults and latency

The demo system is deployed with Docker Compose and includes:

customer-service

products-service

shopping-service

gateway (Nginx reverse proxy)

nosql-db (MongoDB)

rabbitmq

otel-collector

jaeger

🔍 Core Services

customer-service – user registration, login, profile, and customer data

products-service – product catalog, categories, wishlist and cart APIs

shopping-service – shopping cart, orders, and integration with RabbitMQ events

All three services are instrumented with OpenTelemetry SDK for Node.js. Each service sends traces to the OTLP HTTP endpoint of the OTel Collector (http://otel-collector:4318/v1/traces), which then forwards them to Jaeger over OTLP/gRPC.

🧪 Test Scenarios

The project evaluates the system using four main scenarios, aligned with the approved thesis proposal.

1️⃣ Load Test – Increasing Traffic with Locust

We generate a high number of concurrent requests to the system using Locust in order to:

Measure requests per second (RPS)

Observe latency for each service

Track error rate under load

This scenario represents the normal case where all services are healthy and the database responds normally.

2️⃣ Database Bottleneck – Slow MongoDB Responses

We use Toxiproxy to inject artificial latency into MongoDB. A proxy named mongodb_proxy listens on a local port and forwards traffic to nosql-db:27017 while adding delay:

# Create MongoDB proxy
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8474/proxies" `
  -Method POST `
  -Headers @{ "User-Agent" = "curl" } `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body '{"name":"mongodb_proxy","listen":"0.0.0.0:8666","upstream":"nosql-db:27017"}'


# Inject latency fault
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8474/proxies/mongodb_proxy/toxics" `
  -Method POST `
  -Headers @{ "User-Agent"="curl" } `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body '{"name":"mongo_delay","type":"latency","attributes":{"latency":500,"jitter":100}}'


# Remove the fault
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8474/proxies/mongodb_proxy/toxics/mongo_delay" `
  -Method DELETE `
  -Headers @{ "User-Agent" = "curl" }

In Jaeger, the MongoDB-related spans become significantly longer, clearly indicating that the database layer is the bottleneck.

3️⃣ Application Error – HTTP 500

In this scenario, we intentionally trigger an HTTP 500 error from one of the services (for example, by throwing an exception inside a handler).

In Jaeger we can see:

The root span marked with error

The failing operation highlighted

How the error propagates through other spans in the same trace

This helps demonstrate how distributed tracing can be used to pinpoint the exact failing component and understand the impact of an application bug.

4️⃣ Service Downtime – Stopping a Container

We simulate a partial system outage by stopping one microservice while requests are still being sent, for example:

docker compose stop shopping-service

The results seen in Jaeger:

Traces show failed calls to the missing service

Spans that call this service contain connection errors or timeouts

We can observe how a single failing dependency affects the end-to-end request flow

This scenario highlights how tracing helps debug incidents and dependency failures in a microservices architecture.

📊 Locust User Flow

The load test is implemented in locustfile.py. Each virtual user performs a realistic e‑commerce flow:

Authenticate – sign up (optional) and log in to obtain a JWT token

Browse products – list products, filter by category, view product details

Wishlist actions – view wishlist, add an item to wishlist

Cart actions – add item to cart, remove item from cart

Shopping APIs – view current cart, view order history, create an order

All requests go through the Nginx gateway (http://localhost:8080) so that distributed traces represent a full end‑to‑end path from gateway → services → MongoDB.

🛠️ Technology Stack
Layer	Tools / Technologies
Backend	Node.js, Express, Mongoose
Data	MongoDB
Messaging	RabbitMQ
Gateway	Nginx (reverse proxy)
Observability	OpenTelemetry SDK, OpenTelemetry Collector, Jaeger
Load Testing	Locust
Fault Injection	Toxiproxy
Deployment	Docker, Docker Compose
▶️ How to Run
1. Start the stack
docker compose up --build
2. Access main components

Application (via gateway): http://localhost:8080

Jaeger UI: http://localhost:16686

3. Run Locust
locust -f locustfile.py

Open the Locust web UI (usually http://localhost:8089), configure number of users and spawn rate, and start the test.
